            The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer a
            skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any
            business. <br> <br>
            I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young
            minds about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities. <br> <br>
            As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself. <br> <br>
            A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean. <br> <br>
            "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts
            being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're passionate
            about. <br> <br>
            I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.
