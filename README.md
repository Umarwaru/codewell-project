Html &amp; CSS practice project

This is my first project practising html & css in a while, so it was time consuming and imperfect. I am still very rusty overall and still need to polish the project. I will still publish this
for you all to critisize and suggest more efficient methods. I used flexbox layout mostly, and manually set the margins. I think this layout would work best with the grid layout, so when I learn it 
I may redesign this page. Thank You!
